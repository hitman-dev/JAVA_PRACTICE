1. Design a system for “ABC university “ to store information about students and faculties
for students store sid,sname,degree,m1,m2,m3 but student can be bachelor student or a
phd student
for phd student store thesisname,guide,thesismarks
bachelor student store internshipcompany,spsubject,marks for sp.subjec
faculty fid,fname,spsub,skills,sal
calculateSal()
 sal + 10%sal DA + 15%sal HRA-8% sal PF
