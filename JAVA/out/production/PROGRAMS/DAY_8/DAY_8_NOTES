
------inheritance and polymorphism
advantages
1. when you want to increse reusablity of the code
2. size of gets reduced.
3. finding errors becomes
4. maintainance of the code is easy

abstract classes
interface
parent class
child class

------- 4 types of inheritance
1. single level
2. multileve;
3. multiple
4. hybrid

Java support single level inheritance, multilevel inheritance only
because in java one class can have only one parent

But using Interface indirect we can use Multiple and hybrid inheritance

----child class costructor always calls parents default constructor by default
use super keyword to call parametrised constructor explicitly
---super has to be the first line of the constructor.

------to call another constructor of same class use this keyword.


---parent class reference can pont to child class
---- to call any methodfrom child class using parent class reference
then
1. add that method in parent class and override the method in child
2. explicitely typecast the object.

because child class object is implicitly converted into parent class referencebut vice
versa is not true

upcasting is implicit but downcasting is explicit
