-----It is good practice that write main method in separate class
---and all functions in separate class and call that class as util class
or service class


-----packages in java
why we store classes in different packages
1. better organization , hence managing data is easy.
2. easy to import
3. to avoid naming confilt use packages

---if class is in different package then it is neccessary
to import the class
----only public classes are accessible ouside packages.
