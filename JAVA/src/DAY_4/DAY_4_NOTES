Scanner is a class which helps to read data from keboard or file
sc.next() and sc.nextLine() these are used for reading string
--- sc.next() will read the string without spaces and it will not remove
\n from scanner buffer

--- sc.nextLine() will read the string with spaces and it will terminate when it will
read \n, it will remove \n from scanner buffer

---to print formatted output use format or printf function
 System.out.format("%d * %d = %d\n",i,num,(i*num));
 or
 System.out.printf("%d * %d = %d\n",i,num,(i*num));

 %d --- display int
 %f   float
 %s   String
 %c   Char

---to print data on the same line by next print staements
 System.out.print();  ///

---- to print on the next line
  System.out.println();

///conditional statements
if statements
if statement contains only one statement the curly
braces are not manditory, else is optional

if(condition){

}else{
   if(){

   }
}

switch case


----- loops in java
for loop ----counter loop
///if we know how many times to repeate then we use for loop
for(intialization;condition;increment/decrement)
//all these sections are optional
for(;;){    ////this will become infinite for loop
}

int i=1;
for(;i<12;){   /// only condition is given

  i++;
}

for(int i=0,j=0; i< 10;i=i+3){

}

2. while loop // while is used when you don't know how many times to repeate the
statements
///top tested loop
while(condition){

}

3. do...while
when you want to repeate statements atleast once after that you want to
test the condition
///bottom tested loop
do{

}while(condition);

//break and continue

if you want to forcefully stops the loop then use break statement

countinue skips the portion of the loop written below.
and bring the control at the begining of the loop,
